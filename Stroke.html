  <h1>Stroke</h1>
  
    <p class="moveleft marginr largerfont">
      Stroke is an acute neurological emergency. Just as any other organ, brain too has a blood supply to supply oxygen to its nerves. Any abnormality in this blood supply can lead to stroke. As such, it can be of 2 types: Ischemic, where there is an obstruction to blood flow and hemorrhagic, in which the blood vessels in the brain rupture causing internal bleeding.
      <br><br>
      Symptoms are usually sudden in onset and depend on the area affected. Common symptoms include weakness of one side of body or any of the limbs, deviation of mouth, swallowing difficulty, numbness of one side of body, inability to speak, lack of clarity in speech, loss of balance, visual symptoms, behavioural changes, memory disturbances, decreased consciousness, headache and seizures. 
      <br><br>
      In ischemic stroke, there are treatments available to dissolve the clot (thrombolysis) or remove the clot (mechanical thrombectomy) depending on the time lapsed between the beginning of symptoms, and treatment initiation. While thrombolysis in ischemic stroke is approved for within 4.5 hours from stroke onset, mechanical thrombectomy in ischemic stroke is approved for within 6 hours of onset and in some cases upto 24 hours from stroke onset. It is generally accepted that earlier time to treatment is associated with better outcomes.
      In some patients, surgery may be needed to save the life if there is a swelling in the brain. 
      <br><br>
      Evaluation for cause of stroke involves brain and neck vessel imaging, heart check up and blood tests as required depending on the patient's condition. Medication for the prevention of further strokes is warranted. Medication for stroke prevention are usually decided based on the cause of stroke.
