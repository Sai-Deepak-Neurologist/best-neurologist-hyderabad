  <h1>Parkinson's disease</h1>
  <p class="largerfont moveleft marginr">
    <br>
    Parkinon's disease (PD) is a type of neuro-degenerative illness in which predominantly, dopamine producing nerve cells in the brain die.
    As a result of this, patients may develop tremors, slowness, stiffness and imbalance.
    <br><br>
    Apart from this, patients may also develop a variety of other symptoms like constipation, sleep problems, memory and psychiatric issues, and urinary problems. The type of symptoms in an individual depend on the types of nerve cells that are damaged.
    <br><br>
    Most patients with Parkinson's disease respond well to oral levodopa tablets in the initial few years of illness. However, as the disease advances, patients experience increasing symptoms needing advanced therapies.
    <br><br>
    At our centre, we provide world class treatment for Parkinson's disease including medication optimisation in intial years, followed by depending on the requirement and eligibility, advanced PD treatment options including Deep brain stimulation and Apomorphine injections.
    <br><br>
Apart from patient care, our centre is also one of the active research teams in Parkinson's disease in our country. With extensive experience in treating patients with advanced PD, Citi Neuro Centre also runs a fellowship programme to train general neurologists in Parkinson's disease and movement disorders. 
We believe that the spread of knowledge goes a long way in improving the lives of patients with PD in the community.
