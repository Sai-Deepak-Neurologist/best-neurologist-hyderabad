  <h1>Myasthenia and Muscle diseases</h1>

<p class="moveleft marginr largerfont">
  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction in which the site of connection between nerve and muscle is abnormal. This can lead to weakness which is variable and worsens with activity. Weakness may affect the limbs causing walking difficulty. In some, it can affect the eyes causing drooping of lids and double vision. 
  <br><br>
  In severe cases, throat may get affected causing swallowing difficulty and choking. Breathing difficulty can occur if the chest muscles are involved. Such patients may even need ventilatory support.
  <br><br>
  Diagnosis is established by nerve conduction study, blood testing for acetyl choline receptor antibodies and chest CT scan showing abnormalities in thymus.
  Treatment may involve plasma exchange, IV immunoglobulins, steroids and other immunosuppressant medication along with symptomatic treatment.
  Surgery may be required if thymus shows abnormalities.
  <br><Br>
  Apart from Myasthenia, primary muscle diseases may occur in which neuromuscular junction is normal but the muscle is diseased.
  They may be genetically determined with onset in childhood or adulthood, or non genetic such as autoimmune (myositis), malignancy related (paraneoplastic), nutritional (myopathy), infective (myositis) and other causes.
  <br><br>
  Diagnosis may require needle electromyography (EMG) in which electrode is placed inside the muscle to note its activity and identify pathology. Related tests such as serum creatine kinase (CPK), genetic tests and other blood tests may be required.  
  Treatment involves physical therapy and rehabilitation, genetic counselling in genetic diseases, and specific treatment according to the cause of disease wherever possible such as steroids in autoimmune myositis.
