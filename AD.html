  <h1>Alzheimer's disease</h1>
  <br>
  <p class="largerfont moveleft marginr">
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neuro-degenerative illness, in which the nerve cells responsible for memory and other higher cognitive functions die.
Usually, it affects the areas responsible for episodic memory which code for the events that occur in our life. 
<br><br>
As the disease progresses, patients tend to lose other functions such as spatial memory, forgetting things such as the location of rooms in the house, or location of the house on a street. In the advanced stages, patients are usually completely dependent on caregivers with severe loss of cognitive abilities.
<br><br>
To establish a diagnosis in suspected AD, we perform clinical cognitive evaluation with standardised instruments in which we ask the patient to perform various memory, reading, writing, and speaking tasks amongst other things.
Brain imaging with MRI may be needed and some blood tests may be done to rule out any other contributory problems.
<br><br>
Although there is no proven cure for AD currently, our team of experts including neurologists, psychiatrists and psychologists at Citi neuro centre, provide a holistic care to patients with AD. We endevour to keep the patient independent of activities of daily living for as long as possible and give the best symptomatic support and improve the quality of life.
