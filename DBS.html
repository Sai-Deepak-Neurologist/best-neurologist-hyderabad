  <h1>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</h1>
  
  <p class="margin largerfont marginr">DBS is an advanced neurosurgical procedure in which deeper regions of the brain are stimulated using electric current through electrodes implanted inside the brain.
It is useful in treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and dystonia, and certain other neurological and psychiatric illnesses.
<br><br>
Our team at Citi Neuro Centre has a vast experience with DBS in movement disorders. A holistic approach to patient care is followed with the involvement of neurologist, neurosurgeon, psychiatrst, psychologist, anaesthesia and nursing teams.
<br><br>
An initial assessment is done by the neurologist to ensure appropriate patient selection following stringent eligibility criteria for DBS. 
The entire team sees the patient prior to surgery specifically looking for any redflags.
DBS is suggested only after establishing the fitness of the patient for surgery.
<br><br>
In the initial part of the DBS surgery, patient is awake during which time, we assess the effects of current on the patient's symptoms and signs. 
Once satisfactory placement of the DBS electrodes is achieved, battery implantation is done under general anesthesia.
<br><br>
After the surgery, DBS programming is done by the neurologist so that appropriate amount of current reaches the target tissue. 
Depending on the site of stimulation, we expect to reduce the pre operative medication dose depending also on the patient response. Overall, we expect improvement in symptoms over few weeks to few months, leading to an improvement in the patient's quality of life.
